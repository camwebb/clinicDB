<h2 id="battery">Battery</h2>
<p>I tested a smallish power pack (5.2 Ah, 5 V, max 2.1 A), which was also rated at 18.7 Wh (though 5.2 @ 5V = 26 Wh?) and got more than 4.5 hours of use with a headless Raspberry Pi 4B. The <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/specifications/">specifications</a> of the RPi 4B say a 2.5A supply will be sufficient with downstream USB draw of &lt;0.5 A. At 2 A, a 5.2 Ah supply should only give ~2.5 hours, so it seems a headless setup is drawing far less that 2 A. In fact, <a href="https://raspi.tv/2019/how-much-power-does-the-pi4b-use-power-measurements">this site</a> indicates that the headless may draw as little as 0.6 A, giving a battery time of up to 8 hours on a 5.2 Ah power pack. A larger 17.7 Ah power pack may thus give over 25 hours of charge.</p>
<h2 id="shutdown">Shutdown</h2>
<p><em>It is very important not to suddenly disconnect the RPi from a power supply. The operating system needs to cleanly shutdown, and a sudden loss of power may corrupt the files system.</em></p>
<p>During usual operation...</p>
<p>If for some reason the web interface is not available or not responsive, a forced but safe shutdown may be initiated in this way:</p>
<ul>
<li>Connect push-on wires to pins 5 and 6 of the GPIO (the General Purpose In/Out pins on the side of the RPi). These are the pair of pins third from the end farthest from the USB ports.</li>
<li>Connect the loose ends of the wires, so as to create a ‘short’, or closed sircuit.</li>
<li>The shutdown process will begin. Watch the green activity light; it will flicker for 5-10 seconds and then go dark (the red power light will continue to be lit). At this time the system has shut down and it is safe to disconnect the power.</li>
<li>Note: in a pinch, a penknife blade or screwdriver can be used to short these two pins.</li>
</ul>
