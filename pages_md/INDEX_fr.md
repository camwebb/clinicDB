# KlinikDB (fr)

_A lightweight, customizable patient and pharmacy database for small
medical clinics_

KlinikDB runs as a server on either a (cheap) laptop or a
[RaspberryPi][1], and is accessed via a local wifi network using a web
browser on a clinet laptop or smartphone. _No internet connection is
needed._ Patient privacy is a priority, and database backups are
encrypted.

The core data elements are: 1. **Patient records**: clinic visits,
diagnoses, and drug prescriptions, 2. **Patient services accounting**,
based on patient visits, charges and payments, and 3. **Drug stock
management**.  Optional data elements developed to date are: Integrated
forest conservation reporting for patientsâ€™ villages, Alternative
patient payment system (seedlings, manure, etc), Lab tests

Open source development
([Github](https://github.com/camwebb/klinikDB/)), built on an open
source (free) platform. KlinikDB was developed at two small
[clinics](https://alamsehatlestari.org) in Indonesian Borneo, and has
been in daily operation for over 10 years, managing data for over
35,000 patients.
