# Backing up the database

 * After each data entry session, make a <a
              href="cgi/run">backup</a>. Copy the backup file to
              Flashdrive 1. This file (ending in <tt>.sql.gz.asc</tt>)
              is encrypted. Only Yudi and Cam have the keys to decrypt
              it. Therefore, the data on the flashdrive cannot be read
              if the flashdrive is lost or stolen.
 * CSV
  * After each data entry session, also copy the new patient
              CSV file to the clinic computer, and open in Excel.
 * Once a month, copy the latest backup to Flashdrive
              2. Keep Flashdrive 2 somewhere different than Flashdrive
              1.
