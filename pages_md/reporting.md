# Reporting

Reports are generated by an independent software tool that directly
queries the underlying database.  To access reports, click the Tools
button.  As currently configured, summary reports are available to all
viewers of the general pages, even if not logged in.  This policy
should be reviewed as new reports are added. The existing reports are:

 * Patient summaries, by time period. If an annual or quarterly report
   format requires monthly summaries (e.g., for a graph), run the
   report several times, using each month as a time period, and
   combine the results.
 * Drugs in stock
 * Drugs that need to be ordered
 * Drugs soon to expire
