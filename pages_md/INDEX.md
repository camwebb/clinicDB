# ClinicDB

_A lightweight, customizable patient and pharmacy database for small
medical clinics_

ClinicDB was developed at two small
   [clinics](https://alamsehatlestari.org) in Indonesian Borneo. 

ClinicDB runs as a server on either a (cheap) laptop or a
   [RaspberryPi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/), and is accessed via a
   local wifi network using a web browser on a clinet laptop or
   smartphone. _No internet connection is needed._ Patient privacy is a
   priority, and database backups are encrypted.

The core data elements are: 1. Patient records: clinic visits,
   diagnoses, and drug prescriptions, 2. Patient services accounting,
   based on patient visits, charges and payments, and 3. Drug stock
   management

Optional data elements developed to date are: Integrated forest
conservation reporting for patientsâ€™ villages, Alternative patient
payment system (seedlings, manure, etc), Lab tests

Open source development
   ([Github](https://github.com/camwebb/clinicDB/)), built on an
   open source (free) platform.
