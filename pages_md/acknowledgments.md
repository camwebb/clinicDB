From its beginnings in 2008 up to 2020 KlinikDB (implemented as asriDB
and bbbrDB) has been a volunteer project of
[Cam Webb](https://camwebb.info). The asriDB instance continues to be
worked on as a volunteer.  Beginning in late 2020
[Health in Harmony](https://healthinharmony.org/) contributed
financially to development of the bbbrDB instance, and to the
generalized form presented here as KlinikDB (in preparation for
possible deployment in Madagascar).

In its initial stages, Dr. Kinari Webb gave major input on table
elements and form design, and over the years many ASRI and BBBR
doctors, nurses, pharmacists, data entry staff, and conservation staff
have helped with ideas and feedback.  ASRIâ€™s IT expert, Yudi Mirza,
has tweaked asriDB and kept it running daily since ca. 2012.  It
continues to be a pleasure to assist and work with these people.
