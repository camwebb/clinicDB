# Workflow

Based on our experience at the ASRI and BBBR clinics, and recognizing
the need to be able to continue medical service in the event of an
extended power cut or database failure, we strongly recommend that all
data be originally collected on paper.  These paper medical records
can be transcribed into the database as time is available. The digital
system is then used for: searching for patient record numbers,
quarterly reporting and other analysis, and providing access to
patient data away from the physical records (e.g., on a mobile clinic
tour).

Paper patient records are stored in a safe (locked) cabinet, sorted by
Patient Record Number (PRN). Each ‘record’ consists of:

 1. A cardboard folder labeled with PRN and name. Pages inside are
    either stapled to the folder, or enclosed in a way that they cannot
    fall out.
 2. A ‘Basic Data’ form (in a unique color): name, village, DOB,
    mother’s name, father’s name, spouse’s name, children’s names,
    phone.  This is created by the receptionist.
 3. A collection of ‘Visit Forms’ which include areas for the
    doctor(s) to fill in: date, history (first visit only), vital
    signs and symptoms, diagnoses, labs requested and drugs
    prescribed.  Any follow-up by a nurse or other doctor, on the same
    visit, is also added to this form (which may end up with several
    pages).
 4. ‘Lab Results’.
 
Every clinic will discover the best workflow for its needs, but a
sample workflow might include:

 1. Patient arrives at clinic, and takes a card with a number on it
 (placed out in order at the beginning of each day).
 2. Patients are seen by the receptionist in order or their cards.
 The receptionist either registers the patient (making a new folder
 and filling out the basic data), or locates the patient in the
 database and retrieves the patient’s folder.  The receptionist hands
 the folder to the patient. It is vital the patient does not leave the
 clinic at this point.
 3. The patients then moves to a second waiting area to await a
 consulting physician.
 4. The physician examines the patient, fills in the physician’s parts
 of the Visit Form, and either sends the patient to a nurse, to the
 pharmacy, to the lab, or back to the receptionist.
 5. If drugs have been prescribed, the patient collects the drugs and
 the pharmacist fills in additional info (signature confirmation of
 dispensing, price) in the prescription area on the visit form.
 6. If labs have been requested, the lab technician signs the labs
 area of the Visit Form. Lab results are added to the folder later,
 asynchronously.
 7. The patient returns to the receptionist, who checks for the
 actions performed (consultation, nurse actions, drug prescriptions,
 labs) and adds activity prices (and a total cost) to the Visit Form.
 This total is presented to the patient for payment.  If there is an
 outstanding debt, this extra amount may be requested.  The patient
 records folder is placed in a stack for data entry.
 8. When there is time, either the receptionist, or other data entry
 technicians, transcribes the key elements of the Visit Form (and
 Basic Data, for new patients) to the database. See [here](entry.html)
 for a guide to working with the database.
